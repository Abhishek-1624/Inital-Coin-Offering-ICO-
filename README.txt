ICO

An Intial Coin Offering (ICO) is a type of crowdfunding using cryptocurrency

Planning the ICO Smart Contract :-

1.Our ICO will be a smart contract which will accept ETH in exchange for our own token named CRYPTOS

2.The CRYPTOS token is a fully complaint ERC20 Token and will be generated at the ICO time

3.Investors will send ETH to the contract and in exchange to that they will receive some amount of CRYPTOS

4.There will be a deposit address (EOA Account) that automatically receives the ETH sent to the ICO contract

5.In this we set the minimum investment to 0.01ETH and maximum investment to be 5ETH

6.The ICO Hardcap is 300ETH

7.The ICO will have an admin which will determine when the ICO starts and ends

8.The ICO ends when the Hardcap or the end time is reached 

9.The CRYPTOS token will be tradable only after a specific time set by the admin

10.In case of an emergency the admin could stop the ICO and could also change the deposit address in case it gets compromised

11.The ICO can be in one of the following states :- beforeStart,running,afterEnd,halted

12.And the admin can also burn the tokens that were not sold in the ICO

13.After an investment in the ICO the iinvest event will be emitted
